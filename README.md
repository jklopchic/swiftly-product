# swiftly-product

<img src="https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/43iqt75vr3pb62gn?svg=true" alt="Project Badge" width="300">

## Overview

This project defines a library to be used to parse and ingest product data, with a robust model to allow for large extensibility.

## Usage

Hypothetically, this would be available via maven, importing swiftly-product as a dependency. Not currently published.

The input model is defined in the requirements (which I would normally link, but that seems like at least potentially a bad idea)
